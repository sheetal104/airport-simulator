# airport-simulator
Airport simulator using queue operations in C.

<br> Problem Statement: <br>
You need to simulate the working of an airport that runs through many units of time. <br>
Let us consider a small but busy airport with three runways, one always reserved for landing, one for takeoff and the third used for landings unless the landing queue is empty, in which case it can be used for takeoffs. <br>
Planes arrive ready to land or ready to take off at random times, so at any given unit of time, the runways may be idle or a plane may be landing or taking off and there may be several planes waiting either to land or take off.

<br> Execution: <br>
Run  `make -f makefile.mk` (for Ubuntu).
